# Pavlovian Motion Sickness
If we can learn to not get motion sick, we can probably become prone to motion sickness unintentionally by getting sick repeatedly in our first headset experiences. Teaching us to feel sick everytime we’re in a VR headset or even think of it.

# Technophobia Sells
Socrates and Plato argued that writing destroys memory and weakens the mind. Of course they just put these statements out without any proof, that’s what philosophers do. Now I don't know if that is false, but centuries later i’d argue newton and einstein have contributed more to humanity on the platform of these mediums they despised. What are people saying about computing, AI and VR? Technophobia sells, people will always be fans and enemies of ideas but the question you should ask yourself is if you’re right.

# Get Lucky
Do not be afraid of Failure, try. All the people you admire are lucky, because there were others like them who tried but were wrong. But together they were very few, who had the boldness to build out and test their ideas. Don’t be afraid of looking stupid, idealistic or in fantasy. All the people you admire looked like that at some point, even if you die stupid, what’s the point of living anyway?

# Time Travel
What if we stop thinking of time travel physically but think of it perspectively?
Theoretically, if it were possible to read/track all variables (or enough, whatever that means). And predict the future accurately, being able to see the difference our decisions will make. Is that not time travel?

# Facebook Bad
Why is facebook bad ?
- They monetize your data:
- They sell addiction:
- They allow the spread of misinformation and abuse
- They attack our right to freedom of speech

But this looks like Apple, Google, Amazon etc. and basically every company in some way

# Science
Any time we learn, we have observed it to take a couple of arguable steps. Those steps - however divided, however long - are Science or "The Scientific Method".

# P2P Competitive Model
- User hosts an even number of games and joins as a client to an odd number of them.
- If all health is full, both players get zero points.
- Games that don’t end with death would be decided by health.
- If the winning player is at fault, it’s a draw(1 point each).
- Matchmaking? - Some little help from a server
- Upload speed, location, ping would be considered to prevent bad connections.
- There would be a local database for all of a player's games home/away, points, health.
- There would be a report and suspect buttons (send local database for scrutiny?).
- I just realized this is pointless
