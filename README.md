# Pavlovian Motion Sickness
If we can learn to not get motion sick, we can probably become prone to motion sickness unintentionally by getting sick repeatedly in our first headset experiences. Teaching us to feel sick everytime we’re in a VR headset or even think of it.

# Technophobia Sells
Socrates and Plato argued that writing destroys memory and weakens the mind. Of course they just put these statements out without any proof, that’s what philosophers do. Now I don't know if that is false, but centuries later i’d argue newton and einstein have contributed more to humanity on the platform of these mediums they despised. What are people saying about computing, AI and VR? Technophobia sells, people will always be fans and enemies of ideas but the question you should ask yourself is if you’re right.

# Get Lucky
Do not be afraid of Failure, try. All the people you admire are lucky, because there were others like them who tried but were wrong. But together they were very few, who had the boldness to build out and test their ideas. Don’t be afraid of looking stupid, idealistic or in fantasy. All the people you admire looked like that at some point, even if you die stupid, what’s the point of living anyway?

# Science
Any time we learn, we have observed it to take a couple of arguable steps. Those steps - however divided, however long - are Science or "The Scientific Method".

# Philosophy
Philosophers are Scientists that do not test their ideas.

# Let Them Eat Cake
Touch grass.
Enjoy reality.
Do it in real life.
All words from privileged people, not everyone did so well in the location and inheritance lotteries.

# Art imitates Life
We say life imitates art because we’re not aware of the artist’s experience in life itself. Art imitates life, the artist is influenced by his/her perspective or model of how the world works. George Orwell wasn’t predicting the future, he was sharing his cynical understanding of the world. If black mirror seems to predict the future, you haven’t done your research yet. We like to focus on the ideas that turned from science fiction to fact but forget that the overwhelming majority stays fiction. Maybe the world would have more exciting innovations if most scientists weren’t inspired by science fiction, because today we have life imitating art that was imitating life.

# The Illusion of Consciousness
I was reading one of those upload-your-consiousness-to-a-computer tropes and thought what if we're not minds/souls controlling our bodies as sci-fi and religions believe. Our bodies make us who we are, a bunch of chemicals with delusions of existence beyond those said chemicals.

# Value in Virtual
I imagine the first cave painters were ridiculed as they made fake animals instead of hunting the real thing. The mistake is assuming the virtual is here to replace the real, of course we're not going to eat the rock paintings of animals. But these paintings where the begining of communication beyond time and space, they must have evolved into hieroglyphs and then writing. Now remember Socrates and Plato argued that writing destroys memory and weakens the mind. Yet centuries later, i argue newton and einstein have contributed even more than they have using that platform.
This simple idea of fake/made-up representations of real things; storing information in symbols, lead to video and computing. I don't have to tell you how important  the internet itself, youtube/wikipedia (and regional variants) are to humanity. How dare you ridicule the virtual when it is the foundation our civilization is built on.

# Make Time to Think
China (or atleast the area on earth we call that today) figured something out, that we shouldn't spend most of our time on survival. They made agricultural strides in producing rice (paddy) that afforded them time to do other creative things like think, explore ideas, innovate and learn. These led to innovations like the abacus, sundial, lantern, compass, paper/printing, silk and most importantly gunpowder. 
Gunpowder was key to the ottomans conquering constantinople. This gave us the muslim trader monopoly on trade with the east - and with africa i suppose. Triggering the European push to find another route around to the east, and eventually the colonization of the new world and africa. Giving us the world as we know it today. We need time to do anything, we definitely need time to make important discoveries or things.

# From the River Nile To The Mediterranean and Red Sea
The first record of Monotheism is considered to be in Egypt, and was put down quickly maybe even erased. Later the same idea reappears in Judea, among people who have a legend of being enslaved in Egypt. Later again (way after the romanized fork) another major instance shows up in the deserts of arabia with only slightly differing legends. One east mediterranean-wide chinese whispers game and infinite wars were unlocked. This is no joke. I was asked to pick a side, my side is with the people losing loved ones to beheading kidnappers and bombs. Forgive me for i'm a 2023 hippy, it's likely that i might end up like those from 1963. Especially if you accuse me of communism.
